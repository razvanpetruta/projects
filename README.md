# My first project

When I was in my last year of highschool I decided that I want to help my classmates 
with the information needed for our final exam. So I decided that I can build a 
website where I can explain c++ algorithms required for the exam and present some examples
of solved problems for a better understanding. <br>

Seeing my website, my teacher decided that I can host it on my highschool's server.
